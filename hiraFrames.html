<h1 id="heading">HIRAGANA</h1>
<p>In early versions of hiragana there were often many different characters to represent the same syllable, 
however the system was eventually simplified so that there was a one-to-one relationship between 
spoken and written syllables. The present orthography of hiragana was codified by the Japanese government in 1946.</p>
<h3>Characteristics and usage of hiragana</h3>
<p>The hiragana syllabary consists of 48 syllables and is mainly used to write word endings, 
known as okurigana in Japanese. Hiragana are also widely used in materials for children, 
textbooks, animation and comic books, to write Japanese words which are not normally 
written with kanji, such as adverbs and some nouns and adjectives, or for words whose kanji are obscure or obselete.</p>
